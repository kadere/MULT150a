/* the game was easy. because there wasnt enough obstacles in it. This game would be harder if
it had more obstacles in it.and I would add less power ups. I really like the whole aspect of the game it was reall unique and fun.*/
/* two things I added was a different color to the obstacles and different shaped particles.*/
